Download the kernel patch that you want to apply. You can find kernel patches on the official website of the Linux kernel or on other online sources.

Extract the kernel patch file to a directory on your system.

Compile the kernel patch:
kpatch-build -s <source_dir> -p <patch_file> -v <version> -o <output_dir>
Load the Kpatch module:
sudo modprobe kpatch
sudo kpatch apply <patch_file>
Verify that the patch was applied successfully:
sudo kpatch list
